# Dog Breed Classifier üêï

## Objective
The goal is to create a Dog Breed Classifier using a machine learning model that can accurately identify the breed of a dog based on its image. This application could benefit various users, including veterinarians, pet adoption agencies, dog breeders, and pet owners. The classifier should handle a diverse dataset with multiple dog breeds and provide accurate predictions even when images have variations in lighting, angles, or background.

## Data Pre-processing
1.	Label Mapping
2.	Data Split
3.	Image Resizing
4.	Data Augmentation
5.	Normalization

## Approach
- PyTorch
- CNN architecture: Pre-trained model(EfficientNetB0)
